# Welcome to the Dustup help centre

If you're looking for guides to using the Dustup tournament bot, you came to the right place! Whether you're a esports admin or a player, we've got guides for all the basic features.

Most users will start by testing the bot. To get the "full" Dustup experience when testing, follow our [quicktest guide](https://dustup-gg.github.io/docs/admins/test-guide.html).

If what you need is not here, let us know in our [Discord support server](https://discord.gg/Zx37vEkzzB) or over [email](mailto:help@dustup.gg). We love to hear from esports admins, and will do our best to help you (and add the guide that's missing!).

# How do I delete all channels and roles for a tournament?

Every tournament inevitably comes to an end, and when it does, you'll want to clean up your Discord. 

## Archive the tournament
Sometimes you may want to clean up your server but keep records of tournament chat logs for disputes or auditing. To achieve this, run `/archive-tournament`. The bot will remove the tournament role from any registered players, but leave the channels accessible by server admins. 

## Delete the tournament
To completely delete the tournament section, channels, and roles, simply run `/delete-tournament`, and our bot will handle everything.

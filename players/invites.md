# How do I invite teammates?

If you're registering for two or more people, you'll want to make sure your teammates can receive tournament notifications.

1.  Get your teammates to join the tournament's Discord server.

2.  In the tournament's #lobby channel, run `/invite`.

3.  Enter your teammate's Discord username (use the autocomplete!).

4.  Repeat the process for each teammate.

Once all your teammates are invited, you can rest easy knowing they'll receive essential updates such as check-in requests and access codes in the **#tournament-info** channel.

## Invite limit

You get one invite per slot on your team. For example, if the tournament team size is 3, you'll get two invites.

## Univiting teammates

If you invite the wrong user, run `/kick-teammate`. This will free up an invite slot for your team.

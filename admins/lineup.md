You can check the latest status of registrations and check-ins for your tournament at any time.

In the tournament's **#admin** channel, simply enter `/line-up`. You'll be provided a basic graphic list of all the registered teams and their check-in status.

A better-looking, branded table of teams will be provided to players after check-ins have closed. The line-up table above is only intended for internal review purposes.

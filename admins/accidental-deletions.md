If you accidentally delete a core Dustup channel (e.g., #dustup-admin) or a role (e.g., organizer, inviter):

1.  Don't worry.

2.  Run `/server-setup` again. This will replace anything that's missing.

If you accidentally delete a tournament channel (e.g., #admin, #tournament-info) or role:

1.  Worry.

2.  Contact our support team and we'll do our best to repair the damage. If our support team are not available at the time, you will have to rebuild the tournament from scratch using the **Create new tournament** button in #admin (or run `/create-tournament`).

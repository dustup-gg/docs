# How do I test Dustup?

We'd recommend following the steps below with a friend or colleague to get the "full" experience, but feel free to forge your own path too!

1.  [Set up Dustup on your server](/docs/admins/setup.html).

2.  [Publish your first tournament](/docs/admins/create.html).

3.  Seed the tournament with dummy team registrations by hitting the **Fill test teams** button.

4.  [Open and close check-ins](/docs/admins/checkins.html).

5.  [Check the teams' registration and check-in statuses](/docs/admins/lineup.html).

6.  [Publish access codes to registered players](/docs/admins/access-codes).

7.  Submit a game's results.
   * [Apex Legends](/docs/admins/scoring-apex.html)
   * Knockout tournaments (guide coming soon!)

9.  [Delete all your tournament channels](/admins/end-tournament.html).

{: .tip }
You might want to use a test server the first time, but either way, Dustup channels are not visible to non-admins until you publish a tournament.

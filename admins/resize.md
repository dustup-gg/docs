# Can I change the size of tournaments if I don't get enough registrations?

Sometimes it just happensâ€”you don't get the number of registrations you expected. Don't worry, Dustup makes it easy for you to drop the size of the tournament at check-in close...as long as you have enough players to play _some kind_ of tournament. 

When you close check-ins, if you haven't met the minimum registrations required for your tournament, the bot will prompt you to resize to a smaller tournament so that you can continue.

## Minimum tournament sizes
Here's some example minimum registrations required for various tournament modes offered by Dustup:
* **Other, 16-team bracket:** 9 teams (7 byes in first round)
* **Other, 8-team bracket:** 5 teams (3 byes in first round)
* **Other, 32-team group:** 24 teams
* **Other, 16-team group:** 12 teams
* **Apex tournaments, 2 lobbies:** 20 teams
* **Apex tournaments, 1 lobby:** 10 teams
* **Apex scrims, 2 lobbies:** 20 teams
* * **Apex scrims, 1 lobby:** 10 teams
 
## How does resizing work? 
As an example, if you set up a 16-team single-elimination bracket, and only 7 teams register by the check-in close time, Dustup will prompt you to resize to a 8-team bracket to continue. After closing check-ins, the 7 teams will be placed in the bracket, with 1 team getting a bye in the first round.

{: .note }
If you don't reach enough registrations for even the smallest tournament type available in your chosen game mode, you will not be able to run a tournament. For instance, if you're running an **Other** (bracket) tournament type, and only get 4 registrations, you will not be able to close check-ins.

# How do group stages work in Dustup?

When setting up your tournament, select game type "Other", then format "Group stage into single elimination".

After registrations and closing check-ins, teams will be placed into groups of 4, and sent to a dedicated channel to coordinate their matches.

Dustup will prompt teams to submit their results after the completion of each match, and update the group standings live as the group proceeds.

Once all matches in the group have been completed, the channel will be closed, and the winning teams will be moved to new channels for their matches in a single elimination bracket. 

## What is the minimum number of teams per group?

You need enough registrations to fill each group with a minimum of three teams. E.g., if you're running a 32-team group stage, that results in 8 groups, so you need a minimum of 24 teams (8 x 3 = 24).

## How many teams progress from group stages?

Two teams from each group will progress to the single-elimination bracket.

Teams are placed into the bracket based on their performance in the group stage, e.g., teams that came first in their own group will play against teams that came second in a different group.
